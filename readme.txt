An age gate is a due diligence tool that, when paired with our complete age verification solution, improves your site’s regulatory compliance.

== Description ==
An age gate is the popup that you see when you enter an age-restricted website, such as one that sells tobacco products, alcohol, weapons, adult-related products, etc. It lets your site visitors know that you have a minimum age requirement, and asks them to self-certify that they are of legal age to enter. If they aren’t of age, the age gate will automatically block entry to your site and redirect them to a site of your choosing. This plugin relies on our external age gate service, you can view our privacy policy at https://agechecker.net/privacy.

If you are looking for age verification for your checkout page with identity matching and photo ID upload to visit our site at https://agechecker.net/.
